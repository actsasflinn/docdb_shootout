= Document-oriented Database Shootout

This code is part of my "Document-oriented Database Shootout" series of blog
posts on http://mikeperham.com.  It represents a series of common operations
performed by applications to get a side-by-side performance comparison.

I'm not biased in favor of any of these systems.  No one, unfortunately, has paid me
a dime to skew the results towards any one system.  I will happily sell out
for exotic cars and motorcycles though.

Improvements are welcome as long as the semantics of the operations don't change. 
I don't pretend to be an expert in each of these system so it's quite possible
there is a better/faster way of performing a given operation.  If so, please document the before and after timings with your changes so I can see the improvements and
credit you for the improvement.
